# Digital Twin Maturity Levels — Classification Framework

**Source:** Academic research (Tao et al.) and industry frameworks

## Overview

Digital Twin maturity levels classify the sophistication and capabilities of a digital twin, progressing from basic descriptive models to highly autonomous and predictive systems. The classification extends from **L0 (static replica)** to **L5 (autonomous co-existence)**, with the core operational levels being L1-L3.

---

## Level Definitions

### L0: No Twin / Static Model

**Descriptor:** Descriptive / Static Replica

**Characteristics:**

- No active digital twin or only a static 3D model
- Describes and depicts the physical entity without real-time data connection
- Measurements are disparate or non-existent
- Sensors are not interconnected

**Use Cases:**

- Visualisation
- Planning and communication
- CAD/BIM models for documentation
- Geometry and material representation

**Key Limitation:** No dynamic behaviour or connection to the physical world.

---

### L1: Status / Reflecting the Real with the Virtual

**Descriptor:** Informative (Real-Time Data) / Connected - Manual

**Characteristics:**

- Real-time data capture from sensors
- Replicates the real-time state and changes in the physical entity
- Continuous monitoring of asset condition and performance
- Primary function: **"What is happening right now?"**

**Use Cases:**

- Real-time status dashboards
- Condition monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Asset visibility
- **FUI/HUD overlays for real-time telemetry**

**Data Flow:** Physical Asset → Sensors → Digital Twin (Visualisation)

**Key Capability:** Reflects current conditions dynamically.

---

### L2: Controlling the Real with the Virtual

**Descriptor:** Informative (Real-Time + Historical Data) / Connected - Supervisory / Decision Support

**Characteristics:**

- Real-time data + historical data or benchmarks
- Can indirectly control the physical entity's operations
- Enables informed decision-making and analysis
- Captures and estimates effects of real-world events using historical data
- Primary function: **"What should I do about it?"**

**Use Cases:**

- Predictive maintenance (early stage)
- Asset optimisation
- Decision support systems
- Supervisory control (operator-in-the-loop)

**Data Flow:** Physical Asset ↔ Digital Twin ↔ Operator (Decision Support)

**Key Capability:** Supports operational decisions through analysis and recommendations.

---

### L3: Anticipating the Real with the Virtual

**Descriptor:** Predictive / Forecasting

**Characteristics:**

- Forecasts future state and operational processes
- Couples real-time + historical data with ML or physical process-based models
- Predicts future behaviour and performance
- Primary function: **"What will happen next?"**

**Data Flow:** Physical Asset → Digital Twin → ML/Simulation Models → Predictions → Operator

**Key Capability:** Predictive analytics and future state forecasting.

## Case 01 (Moskovsky Av) — Classification Justification

**Classified Level:** **L1 (Informative / Connected)**

### Scenario

Real-time monitoring and visualisation of the transport system state. Specifically, displaying **bus arrival times** via HUD overlays positioned above "Smart Stops" in a high-fidelity 3D environment.

### L1 Characteristics Present

- ✅ **Real-time data:** Capture of bus telemetry (positions, estimated time of arrival)
- ✅ **Reflecting the Real:** The virtual scene accurately replicates the current state of the urban transport fabric
- ✅ **Monitoring:** Continuous update of FUI elements based on live data streams
- ✅ **Primary function:** Answers "Where are the buses and when will they arrive relative to the stops?"

### Why Not L0?

L0 would be a static model of Moskovsky Avenue. Case 01 is dynamic and connected to live data streams representing the physical movement of vehicles.

### Why Not L2?

L2 would require:

- Decision support (e.g. suggesting route changes to bus drivers based on traffic).
- Supervisory control loop.
Currently, Case 01 focuses on **monitoring and visualisation (HUD)** rather than operational control or complex decision support.

## Project Focus Areas

1. **Large-Scale Architectural Scenes:** Managing high-poly procedural geometry in USD.
2. **Procedural Logic:** Using Houdini to generate city fabric that can scale with more data.
3. **FUI Integration:** Real-time visualisation of telemetry on 3D geometry via Omniverse.
